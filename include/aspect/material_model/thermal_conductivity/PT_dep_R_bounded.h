       * of position, temperature and pressure at that location.

       * Implementing a material model requires you to override evaluate() and fill the output
       * argument struct instead of implementing the functions viscosity(),
       * density(), etc.. In this case, all other functions are being ignored.
       *
       * In all cases, model_dependence values, is_compressible()
       * need to be implemented.
