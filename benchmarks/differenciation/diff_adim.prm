##################### Settings for melt transport ########################

# the name 'porosity'. Only the field with that name will be advected with
# the melt velocity, all other compositional fields will continue to work
# as before. Material models will typically query for the field with the 
# name porosity to compute all melt material properties.

# Models with melt transport also need an additional boundary condition: 
# the gradient of the fluid pressure at the model boundaries. This boundary 
# condition indirectly also prescribes boundary conditions for the melt velocity,

# If we choose the fluid pressure gradient = solid density * gravity, melt will
# flow in and out of the model (even if the solid can not flow out) according to
# the dynamic fluid pressure in the model. Conversely, if we choose the 
# fluid pressure gradient = fluid density * gravity, melt will flow in or out
# with the same velocity as the solid (so for a closed boundary, no melt will
# flow in or out). This is what we choose as our boundary condition here.
