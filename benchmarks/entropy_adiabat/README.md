This benchmark is a technical benchmark for the entropy advection method as
described in:

Dannberg, J., Gassmoeller, R., Lithgow-Bertelloni, C., Stixrude, L.,
Thermodynamically consistent phase transitions. In prep.

The model setup is described in entropy_adiabat.prm and requires the shared
libraries in the plugins/ directory.
