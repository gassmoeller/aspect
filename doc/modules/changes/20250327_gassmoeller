Fixed: The grain size material model expected the wrong
number of entries for some input parameters if multiple
compositional fields were active. This is fixed now.
Also when new particles were generated in a boundary cell
with Dirichlet boundary conditions for the compositional
fields, the grain size particle property
would be interpolated incorrectly. This is fixed as well.
