Removed: Due to low usage, and the lack of realistic applications, the code
paths for using anisotropic viscosity have been removed from the main assembly.
They are still available and tested as plugins for the anisotropic_viscosity
test and can be utilized if needed. This optimization speeds up the Stokes
assembly by up to 25%.
