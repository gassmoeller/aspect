Changed: The 'radial linear' gravity model no longer goes towards a zero
gravity at the bottom of the domain, but allows setting the gravity at
the bottom to a fixed value.
The new default value was chosen to represent mantle gravity profiles.
If you used the old model, please restore the old behavior by setting the
parameter to 0.0.
