Removed: The 'radial earth-like' gravity profile was not really earth-like, and
was in fact worse than the default values for most of the other available
gravity plugins. This plugin was removed and all occurrences replaced by the
'ascii data' plugin, which by default uses a data file with values from the
PREM reference model.
