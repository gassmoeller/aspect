# A test for the grain size material model. The test imposes simple shear
# across a 100 km square domain with a rheology derived from experiments on
# olivine. The model domain is isobaric and initially isothermal.
# Over time the model maintains nearly constant temperatures, pressures and
# strain rates. The grain size in the test approaches the equilibrium
# grain size for t -> infinity. At 4 Myr the grain size is
# 1.46095252e-03 m, (TODO: test: which is close to the equilibrium value?).
# Viscosity: 1.42574e18 Pa s.
